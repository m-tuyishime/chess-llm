# Chess LLM

This repository contains a development environment for the Chess LLM project. The environment is configured using VS Code [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and Docker.

## Prerequisites

1. [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2. **Open the folder in VS Code**.

3. **Open the project in a Dev Container**:

   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open the command palette.
   - Search for and select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** (or **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...** if youâ€™re using a newer version of the extension).
