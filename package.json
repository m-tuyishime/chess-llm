  "description": "This project presents a comparative analysis of the performance of various Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving chess puzzles. An automated evaluation system was developed using Python to benchmark different LLMs against a diverse set of chess puzzles sourced from the Lichess database, categorized by themes like \"End Game\", \"Strategic\", and \"Tactic\". The system employs the Glicko-2 rating system to estimate and compare the playing strength of the models in a manner comparable to human chess ratings.",
